# Green Kiosk - Empowering Mama Mboga's Business

Welcome to the Green Kiosk project! This project aims to empower Mama Mboga businesses by providing them with an online platform/shop. Through this platform, Mama Mboga vendors can expand their reach, increase sales, and adapt to modern business practices.

## Introduction

This project aims to bridge the gap by providing Mama Mboga businesses with a user-friendly online platform where they can showcase their products and connect with customers.

##  Features

Vendor Profiles: Each Mama Mboga vendor can create a profile to showcase their products, pricing, and contact information.

Product Listings: Vendors can add their products to the platform, along with descriptions and images.

Shopping Cart: Customers can select items and add them to their cart for easy checkout.

Order Tracking: Customers can track their orders and receive notifications about their delivery status.

Search and Filter: Customers can search for specific products and use filters to find what they need.
